Nicholas put up no struggle. Whereas he had no high opinion of ministers and despised most politicians, 
he loved the armed forces and their high command. He also loved Alexandra, but she was in Tsarskoe Selo, 
not with him. There has been speculation that Rodzyanko and others in the capital exaggerated the intensity 
of the Petrograd disturbances when they wrote to him. Undoubtedly Rodzyanko was exasperated by Nicholas's 
persistent refusal to work in cooperation with the Duma, and he was secretly plotting how to remove him 
from power. Even so, his messages to Stavka accurately reflected how workers and soldiers were acting in 
the capital, and now Alexeev was telling Nicholas that if the war was to be won, he himself had to step down.
